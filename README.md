# Polynomial-Regression-and-Classification

This repository demonstrates how to model and visualize data using linear and polynomial regression, as well as classify data points using an SVM with a polynomial kernel. By walking through simple examples, it shows how to:

  1. Fit a linear regression line to noisy data.
  2. Extend to polynomial regression to better capture non-linear trends.
  3. Use an SVM classifier to separate two distinct clusters with a linear decision boundary
